# React Pizza Parlor
TODO: Update screenshots below with our own design
TODO: Update stretch goals and explain which ones we got to
TODO: Kyle will spellcheck things here

The purpose of this application is to simulate a website in which customers can select pizzas from a menu, 
enter in their information, and then review their order and information for checkout.
It will also have a special page (accesible through `http://localhost:3000/admin`) that displays the
name, time, and order total for each of the orders placed.

### SETUP

Server side code for baseline functionality has been provided. 
Create a database titled: `pizza_parlor` 

**Import data**

See database.sql for more database information

**Start your server**

```
npm install
npm run server
```

Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with `cmd + t` and start the react client app.

**Start your client**

```
npm run client
```

## BASE REQUIREMENTS

Your client has asked your team to build a pizza ordering system.

### ORDER - SELECT PIZZA

When visiting [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) display all of the pizzas on the screen. Allow users to add or remove each pizza they would like to order. **For base mode, only allow the user to have one of each pizza in their cart.** Show the total cost of items in the cart in the top right of this page. 

This page should have a next button that brings the user to the **enter order details page**.

### ORDER - ENTER CUSTOMER INFORMATION

Collect user information, *name*, *street address*, *city* and *zip*. This page should have an option to select pickup vs. delivery. The total cost of the order should appear in the top right of this page. This page should have a next button that brings the user to the **checkout** page.

### ORDER - CHECKOUT

Users should not be able to modify item totals on this screen. When they click checkout, the user information, order total and array of pizzas should be sent to the server. After the checkout is complete, navigate the user back to the **select pizza** page.

### ADMIN - ORDERS

This page **should not** appear in the navigation bar. Eventually the client would like to add authentication but for now, it will be available to anyone with the url [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin). This page will display the name, time and order total for each of the orders placed.

## STRETCH GOALS

- Improve the styling of the app using Material-UI cards, buttons, nav bar and icons.
- Allow the user to go back to previous pages (until they've completed checkout).
- Display a list of pizzas for each order on the orders page.
- Add pictures to the `public/images` folder and update the image url for each pizza in the database.
- Add a button on the orders page to track delivery status.
- Allow admins to click on an order and see all of the details for that order (which pizzas were a part of that particular order). For the details of the order with `id` of `1`, it will be available to anyone with the url [http://localhost:3000/order/1](http://localhost:3000/order/1). This route is not built on the server, so you will need to create it.
