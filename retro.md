1. What went well?
Have each team member  write down what they feel went well 



2. What could be improved?
This is about actions and outcomes â€“ not about specific people.

Tough when a few people aren't yet familar with the process, using that process and trying to connect things together

3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint?
Having identified what didn't go so well, what concrete actions can the team take to improve those things?
